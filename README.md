# Finding-the-Perfect-Match-using-Feature-selection
Welcome to a fun and insightful project. In this project we have used machine learning with a bit of real-life humor — inspired by how my mom selected the perfect "damaad" (son-in-law) using logic similar to feature selection techniques in data science!  

  
  📌 Project Description
In this project, we simulate a dataset of potential grooms with various attributes like Job Type, Salary, Cooking Skills, Kindness, and more.

Feature selection methods like  Chi-Square and ANOVA F-test were used, to identify which features are most important in the final selection — just like my mom did, without knowing any machine learning or coing!

  
🔍 Key Techniques Used
✅ Data Cleaning – Removed duplicates

✅ Label & One-Hot Encoding

✅ Feature Selection

Chi-Square Test (for categorical features)

ANOVA F-Test (for numerical features)
